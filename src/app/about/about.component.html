                        Ain't I (AI) Funny (developmental title) is an idea that I had
                        to make endless amounts of jokes by using Google's Search
                        Queries service. Many jokes are simple forumlas. It's the
                        relationship between two words that make a sentence funny.
                        That's the type of joke I want to explore here. I want to
                        automate joke creation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At some point I am tempted to make the project a Machine
                        Learning experiment. Currently, a user decides if a joke is
                        worthy or not. If I had tons of data, I could use ML
                        to make that decision in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For now, it's just an experiment. The project is open source
                        and is hosted <a href="https://www.github.com/jsphweid/AintIFunny">
                        HERE.</a> It's built with Angular 2, TypeScript, and Bootstrap 4.
